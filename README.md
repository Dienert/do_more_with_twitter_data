Weâ€™re a group of data scientists on the Twitter Data team who are helping
people do more with Twitter data in less time. Each of the posts in this
example series provides a tutorial and reproducible case study of getting value
from Twitter data.

Each post's source code and installation is in a subfolder in `./examples/`. We make heavy use
of the PyData stack on our team and each post is written and developed in
Python, though the steps to reproduce the analyses can be done in any language
with good machine-learning and data manipulation libraries. Each post is
primarily a Jupyter notebook and provides a pip-installable requirements file
and a conda environment for easy setup.
