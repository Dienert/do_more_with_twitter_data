Do more with Twitter data
=========================

Welcome to our new series, where our data scientists
work through examples and share their learnings and tips for getting the most
out of Twitter data using Twitter APIs. Each post in the series will center
around a real-life project and provides MIT-licensed code that you can use to
bootstrap your projects with our enterprise and premium APIs.



:ref:`Finding the Right Data<finding_the_right_data>`
-----------------------------------------------------

:ref:`In our first post<finding_the_right_data>`, Fiona Pigott (@notFromShrek) will show you how to get the
Tweets most related to the question, "What do people talk about when they fly?"
She will walk you through:

- Getting Tweets using our search APIs
- Filtering and refining rules to improve the quality of your Tweet sample
- Working with Tweet payload elements (parsing Tweets, tokenization of text, etc.), and
- Basic natural-language processing with Twitter data.

:ref:`Clustering Users<clustering-users>`
-----------------------------------------

:ref:`In our next post<clustering-users>`, Josh Montague (@jrmontag) will show you
will take us through an analysis of people who Tweeted about the 2017 Cannes
film festival. He will walk you through:

- Getting Tweets via our Search APIs
- Working with User-level attributes from Tweet payloads
- Natural-language processing (NLP) and feature engineering
- Building and refining clustering models
- Techniques for model inspection and visualization

As in our previous post, the example is written in Python, but the techniques are language
agnostic and can be implemented readily in other languages with good data and
machine-learning library support.

:ref:`Time Series Analysis<timeseries>`
-----------------------------------------

People commonly use Twitter data to identify various trends. In this next
example in our series, Aaron Gonzales (@binary_aaron) will introduce an overview of methods for working with
Twitter data as a time series. Weâ€™ll begin by looking at the
volume of Tweets that discuss Taylor Swift in 2017, and discuss the following:

- Using the Search API Counts endpoint
- Basic operations and transformations for time series
- Detrending time series to understand local variations
- Using threshold-based methods to detect trends or bursts
- Contextualizing a time series
- Quickly expanding to other pop stars and topics

As in our previous posts, the example is written in Python, but the techniques
are language agnostic and can be implemented readily in other languages with
good data and machine-learning library support.
