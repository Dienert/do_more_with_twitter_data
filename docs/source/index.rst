=========================

Welcome to our new series, where our data scientists
work through examples and share their learnings and tips for getting the most
out of Twitter data using Twitter APIs. Each post in the series will center
around a real-life project and provides MIT-licensed code that you can use to
bootstrap your projects with our enterprise and premium APIs.

- Filtering and refining rules to improve the quality of your Tweet sample
- Working with Tweet payload elements (parsing Tweets, tokenization of text, etc.), and
- Basic natural-language processing with Twitter data.
