# Thinking About Trends With Twitter Data

## Installation

We have provided both a `trends_requirements.txt` file and a conda environment file for Anaconda users.

If you use anaconda, you can create an environment as such:

```
conda env create -f trends_example_conda_env.yml
source activate trends_example
```

Otherwise, use you favorite virtual environment and install via pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can start a Jupyter notebook from within the virtual environment and load the notebook `trends.ipynb`. If you use Anaconda environments frequently, you can use the nbconda extension which will detect your conda environments and allow you to switch python kernels within a notebook.
